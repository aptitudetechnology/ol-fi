Here's a Google search prompt that captures the key concepts from our Bio-LiFi bridge discussion:

**Google Search Prompt:**

```
"photoreceptor cells" "bioluminescence communication" "biological light interface" "retinal tissue light detection" "software defined radio" optical modem bacteria dinoflagellates "visible light communication" "bio-photonic interface" "living optical systems" photosynthetic communication protocols
```

**Alternative focused searches:**

**For biological components:**
```
"bioluminescent bacteria communication" "photoreceptor cell arrays" "retinal ganglion cells" light patterns "Vibrio fischeri" luciferase "dinoflagellate bioluminescence" biological optical modulation
```

**For technical implementation:**
```
"software defined optical modem" "visible light communication protocols" "camera based light detection" "LED biological stimulation" "optical pattern recognition" "bio-photonic signal processing" "living light communication systems"
```

**For research/academic sources:**
```
"biological optical communication" "photoreceptor based interfaces" "bioluminescence data transmission" "bio-hybrid optical systems" "living photonic devices" "cellular light communication" IEEE VLC biological
```

These searches should help you find:
- Research on biological light communication systems
- Photoreceptor cell cultivation and interfaces
- Bioluminescent organism control and modulation
- Software-defined optical modem implementations
- Visible light communication protocols
- Bio-photonic interface technologies

The combination of biological and technical terms should surface both the biological research and the communications engineering aspects needed for your Bio-LiFi bridge system!
