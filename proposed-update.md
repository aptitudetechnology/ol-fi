Tower Registration Frame:
[Tower_ID] [Cell_Capability] [Position] [Auth] [Payload] [Checksum]
    3            4              3        2        N         2
```

BANDWIDTH_REQUEST: QoS allocation request
EMERGENCY_BROADCAST: Network-wide alerts
```

**Add subsection 6.4: Distributed Computing Protocols**
- Task distribution mechanisms
- Result aggregation protocols
- Load balancing algorithms
- Fault tolerance procedures

### 7. New Section: Infrastructure Protocols (Section 12)
**12.1 Tower Operations**
- Cell registration and authentication
- Resource allocation and management
- Network topology maintenance

- Backup and redundancy systems

### 10. Performance Specifications
**Add new performance metrics for infrastructure mode:**
- Maximum supported cells per tower: 1000+
- Network latency: <100ms for local, <1s for multi-hop
- Throughput: 1Mbps aggregate chemical bandwidth
- Reliability: 99.9% message delivery within coverage
- Coverage area: Up to 10mm radius per tower

### 11. Appendices Updates
**Update Appendix A: Standard MVOC Library**
- Add tower-specific MVOCs for infrastructure signaling
- High-power broadcast compound specifications
- QoS and priority encoding compounds

**Update Appendix D: Compatibility Matrix**
- Infrastructure mode compatibility requirements
- Protocol version interoperability
- Migration paths from peer-to-peer to infrastructure

## Key Design Principles for Updates

1. **Backward Compatibility**: All existing peer-to-peer protocols must continue to work
2. **Optional Infrastructure**: Cells can operate with or without tower presence
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Network functions continue if tower fails
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Support for multiple towers and hierarchical networks
5. **Security by Design**: Infrastructure doesn't create new attack vectors
6. **Performance Optimization**: Tower presence improves but doesn't require network performance

## Implementation Notes

- Maintain all existing MVOC specifications for peer-to-peer communication
- Add new MVOC types only for tower-specific functions
- Ensure protocol negotiation allows mixed environments
- Specify clear migration paths for existing deployments
- Define interoperability testing procedures

This update transforms the Ol-Fi protocol from a purely peer-to-peer system into a flexible architecture supporting both decentralized and infrastructure-based chemical communication networks.
