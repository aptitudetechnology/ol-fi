## Abstract

This document specifies the Ol-Fi (Olfactory-Fidelity) protocol, a chemical communication standard for biological systems using Microbial Volatile Organic Compounds (MVOCs) as information carriers. Ol-Fi enables programmatic control and coordination of biological processes through standardized chemical signaling, analogous to wireless communication protocols but operating in the chemical domain.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The Ol-Fi protocol defines a standardized method for encoding, transmitting, and decoding information using MVOCs in computational biology applications. This enables remote control and coordination of biological systems without direct physical or electrical intervention.

### 1.2 Scope

This specification covers:
- Chemical signal encoding schemes
- Transmission medium specifications
- Receiver sensitivity requirements
- Error detection and correction mechanisms
- Security considerations for biological systems

### 1.3 Terminology

- **MVOC**: Microbial Volatile Organic Compound
- **Sender**: System that generates and releases encoded MVOC signals
- **Channel**: Physical medium through which MVOCs propagate
- **Receiver**: Biological system that detects and responds to MVOC signals
- **Chemical Frame**: Discrete unit of chemical information transmission
- **Olfactory Address**: Unique MVOC signature identifying a target receiver

## 2. Protocol Architecture

### 2.1 Layered Model

The Ol-Fi protocol follows a four-layer architecture:

1. **Physical Layer**: MVOC generation and detection mechanisms
2. **Chemical Layer**: Signal encoding and modulation schemes
3. **Biological Layer**: Cellular response protocols and addressing
4. **Application Layer**: High-level biological process control

### 2.2 Communication Model

```
[Sender] ---> [Channel] ---> [Receiver]
    |            |              |
 Encoder    Propagation    Decoder/Response
```
